## Rendering the weather data

It's downhill from here! (At least until the bonus sections ;) )

Create a new component that will render out our current weather conditions for our zipcode.  I don't have any JSX or styles for you this time. Be creative!

This component should _only render when there is a zipcode and weather data on the state_, otherwise you'll get an error!

Pass the weather data down to the new child component that will render it. And that's it! When you are done, you should have a dynamic site that switches the view everytime a new zipcode is given. It will do this without you having to manipulate the DOM directly and without reloading the page!

If you're so inclined, march onwards to tackle the [bonus](bonus-validations) tasks!
