## Bonus 2: Show multiple locations at once

I think it would be cool if our application could show multiple locations at once! I'm from Dallas and I like to be able to compare Dallas and NYC temperatures during the summer so I can make my family envious.

So, instead of replacing the zipcode and weather conditions when a user presses 'Go', we want to store the data in an array on our state, and push new information onto it.

Now how do we render an array of data? Remember, we can use JavaScript expressions inside of JSX! And thankfully, React knows how to render an array of JSX elements! How can we convert an array of data into an array of JSX elements with a single expression? I'll leave that to you.

Once you've gotten that done, you can work on the ability to [delete](bonus-delete) on of the locations.
