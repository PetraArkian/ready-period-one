## Bonus 3: Delete Locations

For each location, add a button with an 'X' or 'Delete' on it. When that is clicked, find a way to delete that item from our application. Remember, we don't want to manipulate the DOM directly, so we'll need to update our state instead!

### Congrats! You now know most of React!

React is a small library as opposed to a large framework like Angular. It does one thing and one thing well, controlling your views. For any extra features, we need to install extra libaries. Some very popular ones I recommend you look into:

- react-router-dom
- redux
- react-redux
- axios
- ...and so many more!
